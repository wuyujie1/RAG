ansinistitl developed maintained conjunction nist biometric identification community .
aforementioned ansinistitl standard provides guideline exchange biometric information various federal state local tribal international system fbi ebts defines requirement agency must adhere electronically communicating fbi .
functional change ebts documented technical operational update tous interim solution major version .
user compliance requires adherence recent major version ebts incorporation tous .
fbi ebts future revision inherit basic requirement logical record set forth ansinistitl standard .
however fbicjisspecific requirement content composition logical record type1 header information type2 transaction descriptive demographic biographic information type4 fingerprint image descriptive information type7 tenprint fingerprint card image type9 fingerprint minutia information type10 photo image type13 latent friction ridge image type14 variable resolution fingerprint image type15 palm print image type17 iris image record type contained ebts .
1.2 file format ebts transaction comprised record .
ebts defines composition record within transaction transmitted fbi next generation identification system ngi another site agency .
record transaction shall pertain single subject data used identify another individual requires separate transaction .
record belonging single transaction shall transmitted together .
may multiple record transaction record type type1 .
record types1 2 used describe transaction subject respectively required .
may accompanied one data record containing biometric data .
maximum number record transaction restricted 1000. order ensure transaction description information read system field within type1 record shall always encoded using 7bit american national standard code information interchange ascii 8th leftmost bit byte containing zero .
consistent specification utf8 xml encoding since ascii subset utf8 .
[/PAGE]

record type default character encoding traditional encoding 7bit ascii .
user encouraged use utf8 u userdefined character type require special control character traditional encoding .
possible switch encoding within xml transaction .
information ascii character see appendix c. first field traditional record 2.001 len shall contain length byte record .
second field shall contain version number type1 record record field contains information designation character 2.002 idc .
traditional record type conveying binary data type10 type99 data field always last field record .
remaining traditionally encoded ascii field may occur order .
type4 type7 binary image record content order recorded field specified standard .
field data record type shall recorded binary information traditional encoding .
domain 1.013 dom field shall mandatory transaction tofrom fbicjis support proper file validation field usage well file interoperability among disparate system .
1.3 change control ebts defines interface fbicjis state tribal international federal organization ofo system .
change data field format within ebts must honor previously published protocol ensure system adversely affected .
since system developed independently convention established coordinate enhancement within various system maintaining interoperability .
convention based tagged field structure defined ansinistitl standard understanding field definition change time system system .
facilitate system evolution system assigned autonomous range field number allowed define meet operational need .
new field made mandatory established functionality enhance functionality system wishing incorporate new definition .
process place every system network opportunity enhance system schedule yet system ever forced make change order maintain current functionality .
1.4 error handling error handling take two primary form within fbicjis 1 frontend error detection 2 internal process error detection correction .
frontend process examines every incoming transaction security mandatory data perspective .
potential security violation rejected transferred immediately system administrator .

rejection occur missing incorrect data received would prevent processing transaction .
following list illustrates type error .
mandatory field missing submitted record set e.g .
